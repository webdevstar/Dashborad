# Dashboard


React-dashboard is a dashboarding application that enables building dashboard and templates.
It mainly supports **Application Insights** but data sources and visual components are easily extendable.

## Changes

### Version 1.3

Version 1.3 contains the following changes:

* Moving application insights queries from client to server
* Updated tests to answer some security risks presented by GitHub
* Updated tests to accommodate the new approach
* Added masking/unmasking of connection parameters (so that client side can only update API KEY but not see what it is)
* Fixed small bugs with Firefox rendering

### Version 1.2
Version 1.2 breaks the persitency paths of dashboard files and custom templates. If you are upgrading to this version, copy your private dashboards from `/dashboards` into `/dashboards/persistent/` as follows: 

> Private Files: Move files from `/dashboards/*.private.js` to `/dashboards/persistent/private`.

> Custom Templates: Move files from `/dashboards/customTemplates/*.private.ts` to `/dashboards/persistent/customTemplates`.
